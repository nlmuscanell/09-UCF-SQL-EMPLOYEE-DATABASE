# SQL - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts


## Background

SQL was used to analayze the data for employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. THe database of employees from that period consists of six CSV files. Both data engineering and analysis were conducted: Tables were designed to hold data in the CSVs, data were imported into a SQL database, and queries were written and performed to answer questions about the data.

In a second part of this project, the SQL database was imported into jupyter notebook so that the data could be further visualized using Pandas. Plots from Pandas suggest that the original date may be fake.
